Life, oh life, oh life, oh life
Doo, doo doot dooo
Life, oh life, oh life, oh life
Doo, doot dooo
I'm afraid of the dark 
Especially when I'm in a park 
And there's no-one else around
Oh, I get the shivers 
I don't want to see a ghost
It's a sight that I fear most 
I'd rather have a piece of toast 
And watch the evening news
Life, oh life, ooh liiife, oooh life
Doo, doot doot dooo. 
Life, oh life, oh life, oh life
Doo, doo do
I'm a superstitious girl
I'm the worst in the world 
Never walk under ladders 
I keep a rabbit's tail
I'll take you up on a dare
Anytime, anywhere 
Name the place, I'll be there 
Bungee jumping, I don't care!
Life, oh life, oh li-ife, oh life
Doo, doot doot doooo
Life, oh life, oh liiii-fe, oh li-ife
Doo, doo dooo
Life, doo, doot dooo 
Doo, doo do
So after all is said and done 
I know I'm not the only one 
Life indeed can be fun, if you really want to
Sometimes living out your dreams 
Ain't as easy as it seems 
You want to fly around the world
In a beautiful balloon
Life, oh life, oh life, oh life
Doo, doot doot dooo
Life, oh life, oh life, oh life
Doo, doo dooo
